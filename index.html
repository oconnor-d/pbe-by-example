        <h1>Programming by Example, By Example</h1>
        <p>
          Programming-by-example, commonly referred to as PBE, is featured in several popular pieces of software,
          including Microsoft Excel.

        <h2>Coming Up with Effective Examples</h2>
        <p>WIP</p>
        <h3>Decompose the problem</h3>
        <p>WIP</p>
        <h3>Disambiguate your examples</h3>
        <p>
          One of the biggest challenges of PBE is that examples are inherently ambiguous. There can be several different
          programs that conform to the given examples, but would behave differently on other inputs.
        </p>
        <h3>Provide enough examples</h3>
        <p>
          PBE works by generating a program that works on the provided examples, but they don't always generate programs
          that work as expected for all input. Sometimes, when providing too few examples, you end up with a program which 
          does something you don't intend. The more examples you provide, the more likely it is that the PBE results would 
          be what you expect.
        </p>
        <p>
          When thinking of additional examples, you want to keep in mind <b>disambiguation</b>, and provide examples that:
          <ul>
            <li>Conform to the expected behavior</li>
            <li>Further define your intentions</li>
            <li>Exemplify behavior on edge-case inputs</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Refactor and retry</h3>
        <p>
          Even if you provide a good set of initial examples, there's no garauntee the PBE system will get it
          right on the first go. Often times, getting the desired result from PBE requires some back and forth.
          
          When the PBE system isn't doing what you intend, its best to take note of your provided examples, and make sure
          they conform with the aforementioned guidelines.

        <h2>Practice Problems</h2>
        <p>
          What better way to learn Programming-By-Example, then by example! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are some practice problems you
          can use to test out your example-creating techniques. You can input your examples for each task and get
          feedback about the strengths and weaknesses of them. If you need some guidance, you can click 'show hint'
          to reveal a hint for creating a good example for the task, and 'show example' to reveal an example for that
          hint.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Increment each input number by '1'.</li>
          <li>Append the letters 'abc' to the end of each input word.</li>
          <li>Capitalize the first word of each input sentence, if its not already capitalized.</li>
          <li>Extract the domain from each input email address.</li>
