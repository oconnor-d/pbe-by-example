          Programming-by-example, commonly referred to as PBE, is featured in several popular pieces of software.
          As the name suggests, programming-by-example allows users to generate programs by providing nothing more than a few example inputs and outputs.
          PBE can be used to automate repetitive tasks, such as
          <a target="_blank" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/using-flash-fill-in-excel-3f9bcf1e-db93-4890-94a0-1578341f73f7">
            populating a new column in Microsoft Excel based off an existing column.
          </a>
          In order to use PBE effectively, you must be able to come up with a full set of descriptive, unambiguous examples which
          exemplify the task you want to fulfill. Often times, end-users of PBE systems aren't fully aware of what the software is looking
          for in terms of the given examples - whether you're using

        <h2>Coming Up with Effective Examples</h2>
        <p class="indented">
          PBE can only be as effective as the provided examples allow it to be. Examples are extremely friendly towards the user, as all people are able to come
          up with examples of what they want to do, but not all people have the means to implement the solution themselves. However, examples are inherently ambiguous,
          and often do not encompass the entire problem. Since generating effective examples is so important to PBE, and coming up with examples well-suited for PBE isn't
          a widely held skill, I created a short guide you can refer to when coming up with examples of your own.

                  Some problems are still too big to be solved by modern PBE systems in one go. Often, it is necessary to decompose
                  these problems into smaller sub-tasks that PBE can be used to solve.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Depending on which PBE system your using, you should be able to combine these PBE-backed sub-tasks to solve your original problem.

                  <a target="_blank" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/using-flash-fill-in-excel-3f9bcf1e-db93-4890-94a0-1578341f73f7">

                  </a>
                  , for example, you can store each intermediate result in its own column which will be the input for the next step!  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Besides being helpful for the PBE system, decomposing your problem can be helpful for your understanding of the problem, and therefore
                  your ability to come up with worthwile examples.

                  One of the biggest challenges of PBE is that examples are an ambiguous way of specifying a program.
                  There are many possible programs all with different behaviors which could satisfy any given set of examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's best to think of your examples as the full description of the program you wish to generate. In order to fully
                  describe your program, you want to think of examples which encompass any and all specifications you want the program to fulfill.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If all your examples seem exceedingly similar to each other, that is often a sign that they are too ambiguous, and might miss some
                  of the finer details of the task at hand.It is also useful to think of any edge-cases you might want to encounter, and include those as examples.
                </p>

                  PBE works by generating a program that works on the provided examples, but they don't always generate programs
                  that work as expected for all input. Sometimes, when providing too few examples, you end up with a program which 
                  does something you don't intend.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The number of examples you should provide depends on the complexity of the task, and the specific PBE system you may be using.
                  Around 5 is a good baseline to aim for, but you may need to add more until you get a working program.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When thinking of additional examples, you want to keep in mind <b>disambiguation</b>, and provide examples that:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Conform to the expected behavior</li>
                    <li>Further define your intentions</li>
                    <li>Exemplify behavior on edge-case inputs</li>

                  This may seem self-evident, but it is very important that your examples don't have any mistakes in them. Providing a wrong
                  example can lead PBE down the wrong path, resulting in a program which satisfies the erroneous examples without
                  achieving the task at hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If your PBE system isn't working as expected, double checking that your examples don't contain any mistakes is always a good first step.

                  right on the first go. Often times, getting the desired result from PBE requires some back and forth.
